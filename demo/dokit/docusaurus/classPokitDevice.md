The <a href="classPokitDevice">PokitDevice</a> class simplifies Pokit device access.
It does this by wrapping QLowEnergyController to provide:<docListType>But this class is entirely optional, in that all features of all other QtPokit classes can be used wihtout this class. It's just a (meaningful) convenience.
